Select2.js integration with Flask/WTForms and Bootstrap.

This is a fork from https://github.com/pjcunningham/Flask-Select2 adding the options to set the tag parameter. This allows to dynamically create new options.

Code mostly taken from Flask-Admin - https://github.com/flask-admin/flask-admin

Work in Progress.

Simple example added - see examples folder.
